To properly include the new updates in your Ini, do the following:

[Options]
~~~~~
itsover = 20
itsoverbg = 30
thoughtroute = 60
thoughtroutebg = 64



x = coffeepoint#coffeepoint#coffeepoint#0#
y = darkness#itsover#darknessemo#1#
z = dark#itsoverbg#darknessmyoldfriendbg#1#

a = thought#thoughtroute#deepthought#1#
b = endgame#thoughtroutebg#deepthought#1#


If for whatever reason these do not work, yell at lupa because clearly I am perfection
and it could not possible be my fault.

NOTE FROM LUPADIM: Phoenix already has 23 emotes, it's impossible to include those other ones,
I'll let those instructions stay here so that those who want to use them know how to do it
